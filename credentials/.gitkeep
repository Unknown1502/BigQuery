# Credentials Directory

This directory is for storing sensitive credential files.

## Security Notice
- Never commit actual credential files to version control
- The .gitignore file already excludes *.json files from this directory
- Only .gitkeep is tracked to maintain the directory structure

## Files to place here:
- service-account.json (Google Cloud Service Account key)
- Any other credential files your project needs
